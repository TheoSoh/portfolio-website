      <p>
        I hold a <b>Bachelor's degree in Informatics</b> from Örebro University, where I completed
        the <b>Systems Analysis Programme</b> in June 2025. Since graduating, I have worked with
        business development, machine virtualization, Networking and integration flows, while also
        earning certifications in integration development on the Frends integration platform.

        My main passion lies in web and software development. I enjoy building solutions that are
        both practical and well-structured, and I am motivated by the idea of using my development
        skills to solve real problems and create meaningful value. At the same time, continuous
        learning is a big part of who I am, and personal growth is something I place high value on
        in both my professional and personal life.
      </p>

        Would describe myself as driven, social, communicative, and detail-oriented. I enjoy
        collaborating with others, understanding needs from different perspectives, and turning
        ideas into concrete solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I have a strong interest in stocks and investing, and I also enjoy playing
        golf. I am also highly competitive by nature, which shows in gaming as well. For example, in
        CS2, I have ranked around 100 out of 120,000 players in Sweden on Faceit.
